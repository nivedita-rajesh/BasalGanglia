# Modelling Basal Ganglia using Reinforcement Learning

### Project Overview

- **Objective**: To utilize reinforcement learning principles to model the functioning of the basal ganglia, understanding its role in action selection, learning processes, and the impact of neurological disorders.

- **Basal Ganglia Functions**:
  - Evaluate actions and adjust behaviour based on rewards.
  - Complex network involving various pathways and neurotransmitter systems.
  - Dopamine plays a crucial role in reward processing and reinforcement learning mechanisms.

- **Study Focus**:
  - Modelling the intricate interactions within the basal ganglia.
  - Exploring the role of dopamine and acetylcholine imbalance in motor control.
  - Investigating the effects of drugs, such as levodopa, in Parkinsonian conditions.

- **Methodology**:
  - Implementation of a reinforcement learning model to simulate basal ganglia functions.
  - A robotic arm is used to visualize the biological and dysfunctional behaviours of the basal ganglia.

- **Outcomes**:
  - Development of a functional model that demonstrates the operation of the basal ganglia.
  - Visualization of both normal and impaired basal ganglia functions through robotic arm movements.
  - Potential for expansion to incorporate more detailed basal ganglia networks and dynamics.

### Future Work

- Incorporate more detailed BG networks and dynamics.
- Validate and refine the model with real experimental data.
- Extend the model to cover non-motor functions and additional neurological disorders.
